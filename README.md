## How to install for testing
Since this project is in very early development, it has not been posted to an extension store. You can briefly test extension features through the deployed GitHub page associated with this project; however, many UI elements can be displayed incorrectly in this bigger window. To get the full experience, you might want to locally install the extension on your browser.

This extension was made for Chromium, so for the best experience, it is recommended to install it to a Chromium browser (Google Chrome, Microsft Edge, Opera, etc.), as some features might not function properly on other browsers.

### 1. Download extension files
Download all repository files to a ZIP from the green Code button. Make sure to extract all files from the ZIP.

### 2. Go to the Extensions page
Go to the extension page on your preferred browser (e.g., edge://extensions for Microsoft Edge). Ensure that the Developer Mode option is turned on to allow for the installation of unpublished extensions.

### 3. Load the unpacked extensions
Click the Load Unpacked button and find the unzipped folder containing the extension files. Ensure the innermost folder is selected (not the outer folder from the ZIP).

### 4. Test the extension
The extension should now appear in your extensions list along with other extensions. Click to open it and test it out.
